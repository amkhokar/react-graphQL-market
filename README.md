# Full Stack Marketplace Application with React & GraphQL

This is a fullstack marketplace application I made to show the simplicity of the development cycle with React and GraphQL. I would recommend this workflow to any javascript developer, regardless of experience level.

# Full Feature List

1. Authentication (3 way OAuth is the goal, but I may write my own authentication logic initially)
2. Secure checkout
3. Use of graphQL specification for API requests and queries.
4. React-Native functionality (future iteration)
5. Use of React Hooks to keep code base declarative (refactor v3)
6. Use of Styled Components to organize themes and modularize stylying.
7. Slick User Interface with React microinteractions and an animation library
